# MAGIC # Task 3 - Advanced Feature Engineering
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This notebook is the third task in our MLOps pipeline workflow. Here, we will load the transformed loan data, create additional complex features, validate the engineered features, and save the advanced feature-engineered dataset for model training.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Objectives:**
# MAGIC - Load the transformed loan dataset from Task 2.
# MAGIC - Create additional features that can enhance model performance, including debt-to-income ratio, total assets indicator, and credit usage category.
# MAGIC - Validate the data schema and sample output to ensure correctness.
# MAGIC - Save the feature-engineered dataset in Delta format for efficient storage and retrieval in subsequent pipeline steps.

# MAGIC ## Task Outline:
# MAGIC In this task, we will enhance the loan data further by adding complex features for improved model training.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - **Load the Transformed Loan Data:** Load the data saved from Task 2 for advanced feature engineering.
# MAGIC - **Create Additional Complex Features:** Add new features to capture important relationships, such as debt-to-income ratio, total assets, and credit usage.
# MAGIC - **Validate and Inspect the Data:** Check the schema and sample output for accuracy.
# MAGIC - **Save the Engineered Dataset:** Store the dataset in Delta format, making it accessible for model training in the next stage.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ###Step 1: Load the Transformed Loan Data
# MAGIC In this step, we load the transformed loan dataset saved from Task 2. This will serve as the base dataset for advanced feature engineering.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Instructions:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Define the path to the transformed data from Task 2.
# MAGIC - Use the Spark DataFrame API to load the data and display a sample to confirm it loaded correctly.

# COMMAND ----------

# Define the path to the transformed loan data from Task 2
transformed_data_path = f"{DA.catalog_name}.{DA.schema_name}.transformed_loan_data"

# Load the transformed data
loan_df = spark.read.table(transformed_data_path)

# Display the first few rows to inspect the data
display(loan_df)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ###Step 2: Create Additional Complex Features
# MAGIC Here, we’ll create more sophisticated features, such as debt-to-income ratio, total assets indicator, and a credit usage category. These features will provide additional insights to improve model accuracy.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Instructions:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Use sample data modifications to ensure varied results in engineered features.
# MAGIC - Define new columns for debt-to-income ratio, total assets, and credit usage category based on conditions and calculations.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ###Step 3: Validate and Inspect the Data
# MAGIC After creating these features, we validate the schema and inspect sample rows to confirm everything is correct and ready for model training.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Instructions:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Print the schema to verify new columns and data types.
# MAGIC - Display sample rows to inspect the values of the newly engineered features.

# COMMAND ----------

# Verify new columns by printing the schema
loan_df.printSchema()

# Display a sample of rows to check the engineered features
display(loan_df.select("Income", "debt_to_income_ratio", "total_assets", "credit_usage_category"))

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ###Step 4: Persist the Engineered Dataset for Model Training
# MAGIC Finally, save the feature-engineered dataset in Delta format. This dataset will be used directly for model training in the next stage.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Instructions:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Convert column names to lowercase to avoid case sensitivity issues.
# MAGIC - Define the path to save the engineered data in Delta format.
# MAGIC - Drop any existing Delta table with the same name and save the DataFrame to Delta format.

# COMMAND ----------

from pyspark.sql.functions import col

# Standardize column names to lowercase
for old_col in loan_df.columns:
    loan_df = loan_df.withColumnRenamed(old_col, old_col.lower())

# Define the Delta table path
feature_engineered_data_path = f"{DA.catalog_name}.{DA.schema_name}.feature_engineered_loan_data"

# Drop the existing Delta table if it exists
spark.sql(f"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS {feature_engineered_data_path}")

# Save the updated DataFrame to Unity Catalog
loan_df.write.mode("overwrite").saveAsTable(feature_engineered_data_path)

# COMMAND ----------
