# MAGIC ## Pipeline Configuration and Setup
# MAGIC In this section, we set up the environment and define paths for each notebook in the pipeline. We also configure the API headers for communication with the Databricks REST API.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Instructions:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Here, we initialize the foundational configuration by defining:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - **Databricks Instance URL:** Constructs the instance URL using the workspace configuration.
# MAGIC - **API Token:** Defines the token for authorization, which is essential for authenticated API requests.
# MAGIC - **API Headers:** Sets the headers for the API requests, including the authorization token and content type to ensure secure and correctly formatted requests.

# COMMAND ----------

import requests
import json

# Databricks instance and API token
databricks_instance = f"https://{spark.conf.get('spark.databricks.workspaceUrl')}"
api_token = token.strip("{}").strip("'")

# Define headers for API requests
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_token}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Retrieve Cluster ID
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Here, we retrieve the current cluster ID of the environment. This ID is necessary to specify the cluster on which each notebook task will run within the pipeline.

# COMMAND ----------

# Retrieve the current cluster ID
cluster_id = spark.conf.get("spark.databricks.clusterUsageTags.clusterId")
print("cluster_id -", cluster_id)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Define Notebook Paths for Pipeline Tasks
# MAGIC In this section, we dynamically determine the paths to each notebook involved in the pipeline. This setup ensures all task notebooks are linked correctly for sequential execution.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - **Current Notebook Path:** Retrieves the path of the current notebook.
# MAGIC - **Base Path:** Defines a base path for locating all related notebooks in the job pipeline.
# MAGIC - **Task Notebook Paths:** Specifies the paths for each task notebook (Data Ingestion, Data Transformation, Advanced Feature Engineering, and Displaying Feature Engineered Data) to ensure they’re accessible within the pipeline.

# COMMAND ----------

# Get the current notebook path
notebook_path = dbutils.notebook.entry_point.getDbutils().notebook().getContext().notebookPath().get()
# Base path for related notebooks
base_path = notebook_path.rsplit('/', 1)[0] + "/2.1 Demo Pipeline - Data Preparation"

# Paths for specific process notebooks
notebook1 = f"{base_path}/2.1a - Data Ingestion"
print(notebook1)
notebook2 = f"{base_path}/2.1b - Data Transformation" 
print(notebook2)
notebook3 = f"{base_path}/2.1c - Advanced Feature Engineering (Build_Features)" 
print(notebook3)
notebook4 = f"{base_path}/2.1d - Displaying Feature Engineered Data"
print(notebook4)
# Store the notebook paths in a list for easy iteration
notebook_paths = [notebook1, notebook2, notebook3, notebook4]

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ##Pipeline Tasks Creation
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this section, we use the `Databricks REST API` to define tasks for each notebook in the pipeline. Each task is dependent on the previous one, ensuring sequential execution. An email notification is sent upon successful job completion.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Instructions:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The **`create_job_with_tasks`** function allows for a modular approach to building Jobs. Each task is specified by a unique **`task_key`**, and dependencies are established between tasks. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC > ****Important:**** Email notifications ensure that you are alerted as soon as the job completes.

# COMMAND ----------

# Function to create a job with tasks, including email notifications for success

# MAGIC ##Running the Pipeline Job
# MAGIC This section triggers the Lakeflow Job after all tasks are defined, initiating the pipeline's execution.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Instructions:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The `run_job` function uses the Databricks REST API to start the Lakeflow Job by specifying the `job_id`. The output `run_id` is important for tracking this specific job execution in future requests. Use this function to automate the process and ensure timely task execution.

# COMMAND ----------

def run_job(job_id):
    # Send a POST request to start the job with the given job_id
    response = requests.post(
        f"{databricks_instance}/api/2.1/jobs/run-now",

# MAGIC ### Accessing the Jobs
# MAGIC After the job is started, you can access the job details and log history directly from the Databricks Jobs interface. This final cell provides a direct link to the Lakeflow Job, allowing instructors or users to review task execution details.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Instruction:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The link generated is a direct access point to monitor the job execution and review logs or any error messages. This link is valuable for troubleshooting or assessing job performance metrics.

# COMMAND ----------

# Print the link to the Jobs
workspace_id = databricks_instance.split("//")[1].split(".")[0]

# MAGIC ##Conclusion
# MAGIC In this notebook, we demonstrated how to configure and execute a Databricks Lakeflow Job to implement an MLOps pipeline. Using Databricks' REST API, we created a sequence of tasks to handle data ingestion, transformation, feature engineering, and data visualization. The workflow was automated to run each notebook in sequence, and a monitoring function provided real-time updates, including a visualization output and email notifications upon completion.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This pipeline represents a scalable approach to managing machine learning workflows, aligning with the MLOps principles.
