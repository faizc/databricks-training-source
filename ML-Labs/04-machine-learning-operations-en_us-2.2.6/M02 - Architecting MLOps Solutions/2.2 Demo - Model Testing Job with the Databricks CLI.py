# MAGIC ## Configuration of a Lakeflow Job
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This code cell constructs a JSON configuration string for a Databricks Lakeflow job. The configuration specifies a series of tasks designed to handle the deployment and inference stages for a model called "churn-prediction". Here are the key components and their functions:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **General Settings:**
# MAGIC > - **Job Naming**: The job is named using the current user's username with the suffix `-testing-workflow-job`.
# MAGIC > - **Concurrent Runs**: The job runs sequentially with a maximum of one concurrent run.
# MAGIC > - **Email Notifications**: Configured to alert the user on failure.
# MAGIC > - **Notification Settings**: Ensures alerts are not skipped for canceled or skipped runs.
# MAGIC > - **Timeout**: No timeout is set for the job.
# MAGIC > - **Queue Enabled**: Ensures tasks are queued if the job is already running.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Tasks Defined:**
# MAGIC > 1. **Deploy Trained Model**: Deploys the trained model.
# MAGIC > 2. **Model Performance Test**: Tests the model's performance.
# MAGIC > 3. **Model Prediction Analysis**: Analyzes the model's predictions.
# MAGIC > 4. **Summary Report**: Generates a summary report based on the model performance and prediction analysis.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Conditional Execution:**
# MAGIC > - Each task (except the initial deployment) includes conditions that depend on the success of the preceding tasks. If conditions are met, the next task in the Job is triggered.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **File Operations:**
# MAGIC > - The constructed JSON string is written to a file named `workflow-job-demo.json` in write mode, ensuring that the entire JOb configuration is saved externally for deployment purposes.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This setup is essential for automating model deployment workflows in a controlled and predictable manner, allowing for efficient scaling and maintenance of machine learning models.

# MAGIC ## Creating and Running a Lakeflow Job
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This section details the process of creating and executing a Lakeflow job using the Databricks CLI:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **Creating the Job**:
# MAGIC    - The job is created by passing the JSON configuration file `workflow-job-demo.json` to the `databricks jobs create` command. This command returns a JSON object containing details of the created job, including the `job_id`.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 2. **Extracting the Job ID**:
# MAGIC    - The `job_id` is extracted from the JSON output using a combination of `grep` and `awk`. The `grep` command isolates the line containing `job_id`, and `awk` is used to select the second field (the actual ID value), which is then stripped of extra characters using `tr`.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 3. **Running the Job**:
# MAGIC    - With the `job_id` extracted, the job is initiated using `databricks jobs run-now`. This command triggers the execution of the Job defined in the job configuration file.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This process automates the deployment of tasks defined in the Databricks environment, ensuring that the model deployment and associated tasks are handled efficiently.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sh
# MAGIC # Create the job and capture the output
# MAGIC output=$(databricks jobs create --json @workflow-job-demo.json)
# MAGIC echo $output
# MAGIC
# MAGIC # Extract the job_id from the output
# MAGIC job_id=$(echo $output | grep -o '"job_id":[0-9]*' | awk -F':' '{print $2}')
# MAGIC echo "Extracted job_id: $job_id"
# MAGIC
# MAGIC # Run the job using the extracted job_id
# MAGIC databricks jobs run-now $job_id

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Monitoring and Exploring the Executing Lakeflow Job
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To effectively manage and gain insights from your executing Lakeflow job in the Databricks environment, follow these steps:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **Access the Jobs Console**:
# MAGIC    - From the Databricks sidebar, navigate to the **Runs** section, which lists all configured jobs.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 2. **Find and View the Job**:
# MAGIC    - Use the `job_id` (`{{job_id}}`) or `{DA.username}-deploy-workflow-job` to locate your job. Click on the job name to access its details page.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 3. **Explore Tasks**:
# MAGIC    - The job's details page displays its current status (e.g., *running*, *success*, *failure*). Click on a **Tasks tab** to view the created Job.  Click on each task to see the details.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 4. **Explore Run Outputs**:
# MAGIC    - Go back to the **Runs Tab** click on the Runs.  Investigate the output logs, metrics, etc. of tasks for debugging information or to verify successful execution.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC # Conclusion
# MAGIC In this demo, we have successfully set up and executed a Lakeflow job using the Databricks CLI. We configured the job to deploy a model, perform performance tests, analyze predictions, and generate a summary report. This process demonstrated how to automate and streamline model deployment and testing in Databricks, leveraging the CLI for efficient job management.
