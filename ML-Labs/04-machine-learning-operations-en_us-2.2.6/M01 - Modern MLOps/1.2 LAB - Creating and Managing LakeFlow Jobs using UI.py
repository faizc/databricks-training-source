# MAGIC # LAB - Creating and Managing LakeFlow Jobs using UI
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this lab, you will learn how to set up a LakeFlow Job to deploy a machine learning model with manual triggers and email notifications using the Databricks UI. This will involve creating tasks in the LakeFlow Jobs, configuring job dependencies, and enabling email notifications.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Lab Outline:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC _In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:_
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Create and configure a LakeFlow Jobs with multiple tasks using the UI.
# MAGIC - Enable email notifications for job status updates.
# MAGIC - Manually trigger the deployment workflow.
# MAGIC - Monitor the job run to ensure successful execution.

# MAGIC ## REQUIRED - SELECT CLASSIC COMPUTE
# MAGIC Before executing cells in this notebook, please select your classic compute cluster in the lab. Be aware that **Serverless** is enabled by default.
# MAGIC Follow these steps to select the classic compute cluster:
# MAGIC 1. Navigate to the top-right of this notebook and click the drop-down menu to select your cluster. By default, the notebook will use **Serverless**.
# MAGIC 1. If your cluster is available, select it and continue to the next cell. If the cluster is not shown:
# MAGIC    - In the drop-down, select **More**.
# MAGIC    - In the **Attach to an existing compute resource** pop-up, select the first drop-down. You will see a unique cluster name in that drop-down. Please select that cluster.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **NOTE:** If your cluster has terminated, you might need to restart it in order to select it. To do this:
# MAGIC 1. Right-click on **Compute** in the left navigation pane and select *Open in new tab*.
# MAGIC 1. Find the triangle icon to the right of your compute cluster name and click it.
# MAGIC 1. Wait a few minutes for the cluster to start.
# MAGIC 1. Once the cluster is running, complete the steps above to select your cluster.
